## Monte Carlo and PI
Demonstrates the Monte Carlo method by calculating the value of PI.

### Usage
* Choose the verbosity mode to use.
* Provide the amount of points to use in this simulation.
* The program will calculate and display the result.

### Options
* `UseSeed:` When use seed is enabled the simulation will use a predefined "random" sequence of numbers. This is set only once per session.
* `UseVerbose:` When verbose mode is enabled the simulation will print live results to the console.

### Notes
* Approximately 50,000 to 1,000,000 points will provide results near PI.
